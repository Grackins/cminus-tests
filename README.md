Hello!

To use the tester scripts, put `tester.sh` and `single-test.sh` in 
the parent directory of `compiler.py`. then run the following command
in the same directory:

```bash
./tester.sh /path/to/tests/directory
```

Note that the test directory is the address of cloned repository.

Also you can run each test individually:

```bash
./single-test.sh /path/to/single/test/directory
```
